A message input is broken into 3 parts, each part has a different method of encryption to it: rail fence algorithm, hill algorithm, pinnacle algorithm. A sifter asks for input and determines if the message is valid (3 chances). A decoder takes the message and divides it up into the 3 encrypted parts once the sifter determines it is valid. Then, each part decrypts according to their respective algorithm.
